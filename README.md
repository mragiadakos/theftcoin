# theftcoin
A blockchain for the transaction of coins that taxed.

This repository will be abandoned from now on because the architecture is wrong.
The problem is that the tax is not going into the blockchain but as something that submitted in the configuration of the validator.
Which means that if we change the tax then the previous transactions can not be validated. 
I will create a second version of it and maybe I will use ring signature to increase the anonymization of the tax payer.
